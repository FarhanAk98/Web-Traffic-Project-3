These pods contain everything your plants need to grow, including soil, nutrients, and seeds. The convenience of pre-seeded pods makes planting as easy as inserting the pods into the garden and filling the water reservoir. You don’t need any prior gardening experience—just set it up, and let the system do the rest.
